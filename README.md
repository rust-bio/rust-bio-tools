# Rust-Bio-Tools

[![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/rust-bio/rust-bio-tools/CI)](https://github.com/rust-bio/rust-bio-tools/actions)

A set of ultra fast and robust command line utilities for bioinformatics tasks based on Rust-Bio.
Rust-Bio-Tools provides a command `rbt`, which currently supports the following operations:

* a linear time implementation for fuzzy matching of two vcf/bcf files (`rbt vcf-match`)
* a vcf/bcf to txt converter, that flexibly allows to select tags and properly handles multiallelic sites (`rbt vcf-to-txt`)
* a linear time round-robin FASTQ splitter that splits a given FASTQ files into a given number of chunks (`rbt fastq-split`)
* a linear time extraction of depth information from BAMs at given loci (`rbt bam-depth`)
* a utility to quickly filter records from a FASTQ file (`rbt fastq-filter`)
* a tool to merge BAM or FASTQ reads using marked duplicates respectively unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) (`rbt collapse-reads-to-fragments bam|fastq`)
* a tool to generate interactive HTML based reports that offer multiple plots visualizing the provided genomics data (`rbt report`)

Further functionality is added as it is needed by the authors. Any contributions are highly welcome.
