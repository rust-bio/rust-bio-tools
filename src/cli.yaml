  - vcf-to-txt:
      about: |
        Convert VCF/BCF file from STDIN to tab-separated TXT file at STDOUT.
        INFO and FORMAT tags have to be selected explicitly.
        The resulting table can be e.g. parsed with PANDAS in Python:

        pd.read_table("variants.txt", header=[0, 1])
      author: Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@tu-dortmund.de>
      args:
        - info:
            long: info
            short: i
            value_name: NAME
            multiple: true
            help: Select INFO tags.
        - format:
            long: fmt
            short: f
            value_name: NAME
            multiple: true
            help: Select FORMAT tags.
        - genotypes:
            long: genotypes
            short: g
            help: Display genotypes.

  - vcf-match:
      about: |
        Annotate for each variant in a VCF/BCF at STDIN whether it is contained in a
        given second VCF/BCF. The matching is fuzzy for indels and exact for SNVs.
        Results are printed as BCF to STDOUT, with an additional INFO tag MATCHING.
        The two vcfs do not have to be sorted.

        Example:
        rbt vcf-match dbsnp.vcf < calls.vcf | bcftools view
      author: Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@tu-dortmund.de>
      args:
        - vcf:
            required: true
            help: VCF/BCF file to match against.
        - max-dist:
            long: max-dist
            short: d
            value_name: INT
            default_value: "20"
            help: Maximum distance between centres of two indels considered to match.
        - max-len-diff:
            long: max-len-diff
            short: l
            value_name: INT
            default_value: "10"
            help: Maximum difference between lengths of two indels.

  - vcf-baf:
      about: |
        Annotate b-allele frequency for each single nucleotide variant and sample.

        Example:
        rbt vcf-baf < calls.bcf > annotated.bcf
      author: Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@uni-due.de>, Jan Forster <j.forster@dkfz.de>

  - group-by-umi:
      about: |
        Group reads by UMI. Reads are grouped together if they from a cluster with
        a given maximum hamming distance. Annotated BAM is printed to STDOUT.
      author: Henning Timm <henning.timm@uni-due.de>, Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@uni-due.de>
      args:
        - bam-path:
            required: true
            help: Input BAM file with UMI stored in RX tag of each read.
        - max-fingerprint-dist:
            long: max-fingerprint-dist
            short: d
            default_value: "2"
            help: Maximum hamming distance between the fingerprints of any pair of reads in the same cluster.
        - max-seq-dist:
            long: max-seq-dist
            short: D
            default_value: "4"
            help: Maximum hamming distance between the sequences of any pair of reads in the same cluster.
