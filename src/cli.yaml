  - vcf-to-txt:
      about: |
        Convert VCF/BCF file from STDIN to tab-separated TXT file at STDOUT.
        INFO and FORMAT tags have to be selected explicitly.
        The resulting table can be e.g. parsed with PANDAS in Python:

        pd.read_table("variants.txt", header=[0, 1])
      author: Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@tu-dortmund.de>
      args:
        - info:
            long: info

            long: fmt
            short: f
            value_name: NAME
            multiple: true
            help: Select FORMAT tags.
        - genotypes:
            long: genotypes
            short: g
            help: Display genotypes.

  - vcf-match:
      about: |
        Annotate for each variant in a VCF/BCF at STDIN whether it is contained in a
        given second VCF/BCF. The matching is fuzzy for indels and exact for SNVs.
        Results are printed as BCF to STDOUT, with an additional INFO tag MATCHING.
        The two vcfs do not have to be sorted.

        Example:
        rbt vcf-match dbsnp.vcf < calls.vcf | bcftools view
      author: Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@tu-dortmund.de>

            short: d
            value_name: INT
            default_value: "20"
            help: Maximum distance between centres of two indels considered to match.
        - max-len-diff:
            long: max-len-diff
            short: l
            value_name: INT

  - vcf-baf:
      about: |

        rbt vcf-baf < calls.bcf > annotated.bcf
      author: Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@uni-due.de>, Jan Forster <j.forster@dkfz.de>

  - call-consensus-reads:
      about: |

            short: l
            default_value: "8"
