        Split FASTQ file from STDIN into N chunks.

        Example:
        rbt fastq-split A.fastq B.fastq < test.fastq
        {n}
      author: Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@tu-dortmund.de>

  - fastq-filter:
      about: |
        Remove records from a FASTQ file (from STDIN), output to STDOUT.

        Example:
        rbt fastq-filter ids.txt < test.fastq > filtered.fastq
        {n}
      author: Erik Clarke <ecl@pennmedicine.upenn.edu>
      args:

  - bam-depth:
      about: |
        Print depth of BAM or CRAM file at given positions from STDIN (tab separated: chrom, pos).

        Usage:
        $ rbt bam-depth test.bam < pos.txt > depth.txt

        The positions file contains the name of one reference sequence and one position per line (tab separated).
        Example:

        16	1
        17	38
        17	39

        Depths are written to stdout as tab-separated lines, similar to the positions input.

  - vcf-fix-iupac-alleles:
      about: |
        Convert any IUPAC codes in alleles into Ns (in order to comply with VCF 4 specs).
        Reads VCF/BCF from STDIN and writes BCF to STDOUT.

        Example:

      about: |
        Convert VCF/BCF file from STDIN to tab-separated TXT file at STDOUT.
        INFO and FORMAT tags have to be selected explicitly.

        Example:
        rbt vcf-to-txt --genotypes --fmt S --info T X SOMATIC < test.vcf > variant-table.txt

        The resulting table can be e.g. parsed with PANDAS in Python:

        pd.read_table("variants.txt", header=[0, 1])
        {n}
      author: Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@tu-dortmund.de>

  - vcf-match:
      about: |
        Annotate for each variant in a VCF/BCF at STDIN whether it is contained in a
        given second VCF/BCF. The matching is fuzzy for indels and exact for SNVs.
        Results are printed as BCF to STDOUT, with an additional INFO tag MATCHING.
        The two vcfs do not have to be sorted.

        Example:
        rbt vcf-match dbsnp.vcf < calls.vcf | bcftools view
        {n}
      author: Johannes Köster <johannes.koester@tu-dortmund.de>

        - fastq:
            about: |
              Tool to remove PCR duplicates from UMI-tagged reads.

              Takes two FASTQ files (forward and reverse) and returns two FASTQ files in which all PCR duplicates have been merged into a consensus read.
              Duplicates are identified by a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI).

              Assumptions:
                - Reads are of equal length
                - UMI is the prefix of the reads

              Example:
              rbt call-consensus-reads \
                reads_1.fq reads_2.fq \    # input files
                merged_1.fq merged_2.fq \  # output files
                -l 13 \                    # length of UMI
                -d 1 \                     # max hamming distance of UMIs within a cluster
                -D 2 \                     # max hamming distance of sequences within a cluster
                --umi-on-reverse           # UMI is the prefix of the reverse read
